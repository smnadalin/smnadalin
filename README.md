### Hi, I'm Stephen

I'm a React Front-End Developer from Melbourne, Australia. This account contains some portfolio and personal projects.

## Portfolio

- [Capstone - Little Lemon Restaurant](https://github.com/smnadalin/capstone) - the capstone project from the Meta Front-End Developer course. We were tasked with creating a restaurant landing page and booking form.
- [nightowl](https://github.com/smnadalin/nightowl) - a customisable week planning app designed for those who like to work late at night.

## Personal Projects

- [D&D 5e Adventure Miniature Lists](https://github.com/smnadalin/DnD-5e-Adventure-Miniature-Lists) - these are lists of the miniatures from the D&D 5e Adventure guides that I am compiling. They allow DM's to plan what miniatures to print without trawling through the whole book.
- [Loot Studios 5e Names](https://github.com/smnadalin/loot-studios-5e-names) - this is a list of the miniatures from Loot Studios mapped to the 5e names. It helps you to find the miniature you are after from the Loot Studios collection.
